# Formatting Preservation in Book Translator

## Problem Solved

The Book Translator was removing markdown formatting and special characters during the translation process. This was happening due to two main issues:

1. **Aggressive text stripping**: The `refine_translation()` method was using `.strip()` which removed important leading and trailing whitespace that's crucial for markdown formatting.

2. **Inadequate prompts**: The LLM prompts didn't explicitly instruct the model to preserve formatting, leading to inconsistent preservation of markdown syntax and special characters.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Formatting Protection System

Added a comprehensive formatting protection system that:
- **Protects formatting elements** before translation by replacing them with translation-resistant placeholders
- **Uses case-insensitive restoration** to handle Google Translate's case changes
- **Preserves content for translation** while protecting structure

**Key formatting elements protected:**
- **Markdown headers** (`# ## ### ####`)
- **Markdown bold/italic** (`**text**`, `*text*`)
- **Markdown links** (`[text](url)`)
- **Markdown images** (`![alt](url)`)
- **Code blocks** (` ```code``` ` and `` `code` ``)
- **Emojis and Unicode** (🚀📜📂🛡️⚠️🔐 etc.)
- **Horizontal rules** (`---`)
- **List markers** (`- * +`)
- **Calibre classes** (`{.calibre7}`)
- **Line breaks** (`\` at end of line)
- **HTML/XML tags** (`<tag>`)
- **Email addresses** (`user@domain.com`)
- **Cryptocurrency addresses** (Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Prompts for Format Preservation

Updated all language prompts in the `refine_translation()` method to explicitly instruct the LLM to preserve formatting:

**Before:**
```
'en': 'Improve this text to sound more natural in English. Return only the improved text:'
```

**After:**
```
'en': 'Improve this text to sound more natural in English. IMPORTANT: Preserve all markdown formatting, special characters, whitespace, line breaks, and structure exactly as they appear. Return only the improved text with original formatting intact:'
```

This change was applied to all 12 supported languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Serbian, Croatian).

### 2. Smart Whitespace Preservation

Replaced the aggressive `.strip()` with intelligent whitespace handling:

**Before:**
```python
return result['response'].strip()
```

**After:**
```python
# Preserve original formatting by only stripping minimal whitespace
refined_text = result['response']

# Only remove leading/trailing whitespace if the original text didn't have it
# This preserves intentional formatting while cleaning up LLM artifacts
if not text.startswith((' ', '\t', '\n', '\r')) and refined_text.startswith((' ', '\t', '\n', '\r')):
    refined_text = refined_text.lstrip()
if not text.endswith((' ', '\t', '\n', '\r')) and refined_text.endswith((' ', '\t', '\n', '\r')):
    refined_text = refined_text.rstrip()
    
return refined_text
```

## What's Now Preserved

✅ **Complex markdown documents**: Headers, bold, italic, links, images, code blocks
✅ **Emojis and Unicode**: 🚀📜📂🛡️⚠️🔐🚨🆕📊❤️🔗✖💬⭐🙏 and all other Unicode characters
✅ **Technical content**: Email addresses, cryptocurrency addresses, URLs
✅ **Document structure**: Headers (`# ## ###`), horizontal rules (`---`), list markers
✅ **Code formatting**: Inline code (`` `code` ``) and code blocks (` ```code``` `)
✅ **Calibre-specific**: `{.calibre7}` and other CSS-like classes
✅ **HTML/XML tags**: `<tag>`, `<img>`, etc.
✅ **Special characters**: All symbols and punctuation marks
✅ **Intentional whitespace**: Leading/trailing spaces and line breaks
✅ **Complex formatting combinations**: Mixed markdown with emojis, links with bold text, etc.

## How It Works

1. **Stage 1 (Google Translate)**: Preserves most formatting naturally as Google Translate typically maintains structure
2. **Stage 2 (LLM Refinement)**: 
   - Enhanced prompts instruct the LLM to preserve all formatting
   - Smart whitespace handling ensures intentional spacing is maintained
   - Only removes whitespace that wasn't in the original text (LLM artifacts)

## Testing

The solution has been tested with various formatting scenarios:
- Markdown headers, bold, italic, code blocks
- Lists and blockquotes
- Special characters and symbols
- Intentional leading/trailing whitespace
- Complex document structures

## Usage

No changes are required for end users. The formatting preservation works automatically during the translation process. Simply upload your markdown files and the translator will now preserve all formatting while improving the translation quality.

## Benefits

- **Maintains document structure**: Headers, sections, and formatting hierarchy are preserved
- **Preserves code examples**: Code blocks and inline code remain intact
- **Keeps special formatting**: Links, blockquotes, and emphasis are maintained
- **Professional output**: Translated documents maintain their original professional appearance
- **No manual reformatting**: Users don't need to re-add formatting after translation
